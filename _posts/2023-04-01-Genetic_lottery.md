title: Picking the winning genetic numbers
---


*Status: Highly speculative*

Genes have an influence on life outcomes - intelligence, educational attainment, "success" in the many ways as defined in society. What would you have to do to give your children the 'best' genes? There are two options - edit the genes of your future child or pick one embryo out of many to become your future child. The latter option is at our doorstep today.

Scientists have come up with many ways to edit the genes of animals and plants. We have never tried to adapt that to humans because editing genes is messy. But a new technology, CRISPR, is a form of gene editing that has immense possibilities for the future. Some of the scientists who helped develop this technology won the Nobel prize last year. However, editing the genome with technologies like CRISPR is a long way off. Any complex trait like intelligence are influenced by hundreds of genes. Each contributing a small effect. Therefore, we would have to go in and edit all these genes are once and hope that we don't make any mistakes. The technology to do that is simply not here.

The other option is embryo selection. This is likely to be the route that is most accessible to parents soon. Rich people are already doing this so you know it is closer to being mainstream than CRISPR-based gene editing. IVF is used for couples with infertility issues but needs to be expanded upon to include people who could get pregnant "normally". A couple could get 10-20 embryos fertilized in a clinic. These embryos can be sequenced and ranked for a trait that the couple finds important - say intelligence. We can do this because human genetics research has generated "polygenic scores" for different human traits. If you have a particular combination of variants of your gene, then you score high on the polygenic score for intelligence and in a different combinations of gene variants, you score lower. So our couple in the clinic can see the polygenic score of each of the 10 embryos and decide to go with one that has the highest score.

What are the chances that this particular selection will give your child a successful life? - unquantifiable and unknowable. Life is too complex. Â Simply having a set of gene variants that are linked to higher intelligence is not going to be enough. If that child grows up in an abusive family, the genes are going to have limited effect. But it does have some influence. Parents have always done things in the hopes of giving their children a small edge, regardless of whether that particular intervention works. Parents send their kids to extra classes based on learning techniques that have dubious value and they will move to another neighbourhood because "everybody knows" the school in that town is better. Giving your children an extra nudge by picking the slightly better embryo is next.
