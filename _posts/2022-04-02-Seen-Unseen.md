title: Seen and Unseen

April 19, 2013. I'm sitting with some friends in the living room of an apartment in the city of Boston, in the US. The atmosphere in the room is tense, quiet, and nervous. Every once in a while, someone glances at the window and looks away immediately.


The city of Boston has issued a stay-at-home alert.


Why?


An armed gunman is on the loose. A few days before, two people had set off two bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, one of the most famous and popular marathons in the world. Three people had died.


Now, four days later, the police had killed one and were tracking the other one; he had escaped into the backstreets of Boston.


The stay-at-home shelter said very clearly: stay in your home, close your windows and doors, pull your curtains. If you hear any movement outside your house, move away from your windows, find a safe space, and call the cops.


So there we are, sitting, watching the live breaking news on the TV of the manhunt that is underway.


Subsequently, the person was found and arrested, and the alert was lifted.


But that evening and the Boston Marathon bombings are stamped deep in my memory.


But life goes on, and things move forward.


Now let's skip forward a couple more years. It's 2018, and I now live in Belgium. I was a scientist, and being the nerdy science person that I am, I like to read interesting, surprising medical papers for fun. I realize that this is not most people's definition of fun.


And I came across one that blew my mind.


A group of clever doctors from Harvard looked at the effect of marathons on cities, including Boston. Marathons result in a lot of disruptions, with at least 42 kilometers of closed roads for the route.


What the scientists found was that if you had an emergency situation at home, like a heart attack at home on the day of a marathon compared to any other day, your chance of dying goes up by 15-20%. That's nearly 4 to 5 extra people dying than would otherwise.


So, for me, the Boston Marathon attack, where three people died, is such a vivid memory in my brain.


But what they showed was that more people die because of marathon-associated road closures every year in a given city with a large marathon than died in those bombings.


Now, this is a very clever study. It's very non-intuitive and also makes for a fun, hanging-out-at-a-bar conversation starter.


But for me, there's more.


It's a reminder that the world is made up of two realities: the immediate, obvious one and the hidden, not-so-obvious reality.


The seen and the unseen.


Today, there is so much that is seen. Our newspapers, social media, the TV will put things in front of our faces continuously, 24/7, the never-ending scroll.


I'm exposed to it all the time. And a while back, I was talking to a friend about all the terrible things I was reading in the news - the wars, the terror attacks, the shootings. And she asked me a question: Do you know how many people in this world died of malaria in 2019?


More than 600,000 people - half a million people. Mostly in Africa. In Europe, no one has died in over a decade. ZERO people.


The seen and the unseen.


Whenever a marathon pops up in the news, for example, the Boston Marathon just happened, I'm reminded of two marathon-related things that exist within me.


One, a deep, scary memory of a horrific event that colors the way I see the world, and a not-so-obvious thing I learned from looking at the data.


And it serves as a trigger to ask myself - in what parts of my life do I have a partial understanding of reality simply based on what I've been exposed to repeatedly? Of what I can remember quickly or most vividly.


And I tell myself: look at the Seen and then part the curtains and look beyond at the Unseen. And pay attention.


An old saying goes: Your life is made up of what you choose to pay attention to. So choose wisely.
